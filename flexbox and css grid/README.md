# Instructions ‚úÖ

## 1. **Create the Project Folder and Files**
   - [ ] Create a folder named `FlexGridsPetEmporium`to store all your project files.
   
   - [ ] Inside the `FlexGridsPetEmporium` folder, create a file named `index.html`. This will be your main HTML file.
   
   - [ ] Also, in the `FlexGridsPetEmporium` folder, create another file named `styles.css`. This file will contain the CSS used to style your HTML content.

   - [ ] Create a folder named `assets`.

   - [ ] Create another folder named `images` inside the assets folder.


## 2. **Download Pet Photos:**
   - [ ] Go to [Pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com) and download 12 pet photos of your choice.

## 3. **Rename the Photos:**
   - [ ] Rename the downloaded photos to shorter names for easier reference, such as `Pet1.jpg`, `Pet2.jpg`, ..., `Pet12.jpg`.

## 4. **Place the Photos in the images Folder:**
   - [ ] Move the downloaded (and renamed) pet photos into the `images` folder inside the `assets` folder.

## 5. **Download Background Image:**
   - [ ] Go to [Pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com) and search for light background images.
   - [ ] Find something that you think will work with your Pet Store site and download it.
   - [ ] Rename this image to `Background.jpg` and also place it in the `assets/images` folder.

Now begin coding with the help of AI.

## 6. **Add HTML Boilerplate And Background Image**
Now that you have your files set up, start by adding the basic HTML5 boilerplate and the basic structure for our web page including the background image.

  - [ ] Ask AI to generate an HTML boilerplate for a webpage that includes a `header` with an `h1` tag, a `main` content area that includes a `p` tag, and a `footer`. The page should be titled 'FlexGrid's Pet Emporium' and linked to a CSS file. Please include a witty description for a pet store in the main content area, using a `p` tag with the class store-description.

  - [ ] Now add the image named 'Background.jpg' as a background to the project. The background should cover the entire page, be centered, and have a no-repeat, fixed image property.

  - [ ] Copy all of the HTML boilerplate code provided by AI and paste it into your `index.html` file.

**Explanation:**
In this step, you can set up the basic structure of your webpage by asking AI to generate an HTML5 boilerplate, including a header and main content area, which you can then copy and paste into the index.html file.

## 7. **Add Navigation Bar Code**
In this step, you'll ask AI for help to add a navigation bar to your webpage that includes options for "Login," "Our Locations," and "Contact Us." 

  - [ ]  You need `HTML` code to add a navigation bar with "Login," "Our Locations," and "Contact Us" options to the existing HTML boilerplate. The nav bar will be a black bar at the top once it is styled. 
  - [ ] Open your `index.html` file. and locate the `<header>` tag. Paste the navigation bar code between the `<body>` and the `<header>` tags.

**Explanation:**
This step introduces a navigation bar that will allow users to easily access key sections of your site. By placing the code between the <body> and <header> tags, you ensure that the navigation bar appears at the top of your webpage, making it prominent and user-friendly.


## 8. **Add Pet Image Boxes Section**
Now that you have a navigation bar, add 12 boxes for the pet photos with cute pet names and short personality descriptions.

  - [ ] Ask for help to create `HTML` code adding a section under the main content area with 12 image boxes for pet photos. The photos are located in the assets/images folder. The photos are named Pet1.jpg to Pet12.jpg. Each box should have an image, a cute pet name, and a short personality description underneath. Please ensure this code uses a `<section>` tag with a class of "pet-gallery".  
  - [ ] Open your `index.html` file and locate the existing `<main>` tag. This tag should already contain the initial `<p>` tag with the business description.
  - [ ] Paste the code for the pet images `<section>` directly below the existing `<p>` tag inside the `<main>`. This will ensure that the pet image boxes section appears right after the business description.
  
**Explanation:**
In this step, you enhanced the webpage by adding a section that showcases 12 pet photos, each accompanied by a cute pet name and a brief personality description. This section will be visually appealing and give users a glimpse of the adorable pets featured in your store.

## 9. **Add a Section for Location and Hours**
Next, let's add a section for the location and hours.

- [ ] Open your `index.html` file and locate the existing `<footer>` tag in your `index.html` file.
- [ ] Paste the location and hours `section` code directly above the `<footer>` tag.

**Explanation:**
In this step, you're adding a section to your webpage that provides essential information about your business, including the location, contact details, and operating hours.

## 10. **Test your current progress**
Review your progress by viewing the current unstyled webpage in the browser.

  - [ ] Copy and paste the nav bar code from your `index.html` into an AI chat, include everything from <nav> to </nav>. Ask AI to use this HTML code as a reference when building the upcoming CSS requests.
  - [ ] You now need CSS code to style the header and navigation bar, making the nav bar full width, a black background, and locate it at the top of the page.
  - [ ] The text should all be white in color. 
  - [ ] Please use Flexbox to handle the layout and ensure any text is centered within the navigation bar. Make sure to use the navigation `HTML code` supplied previously for reference when building the CSS.

## 15. **Style the Pet Gallery Section**
In this step, you'll style the Pet Gallery section by using CSS Grid to create a responsive layout for the pet photo boxes.

  - [ ] Paste the code from the `index.html` file from the entire pet gallery section tags (`<section class="pet-gallery">` all your code `</section>`). Ask AI to use this HTML code as a reference when building the upcoming CSS requests.
  - [ ] You need CSS code to style the pet photo boxes in the `.pet-gallery` section.
  I need all of the following included in the layout: 
     - use CSS grid
     - The pet name (`<h3>`) should be larger and positioned at the top in each box.
     - There should be no rule between the pet name and the description (`<p>` tag).
     - Each box should have a border around it, and the photo should have a rule separating it from the description.

The section should be centered on the page with text aligned in the center. Ensure the background of the section is fully transparent, include extra spacing between lines of text, and add padding around the section. There should be no border around the section and any list items inside should not have dots (bullets). The content should be responsive to different screen sizes.
